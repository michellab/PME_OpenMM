# Charging free energy corrections with OpenMM PME

In this repository you can find tests and scripts used to compute the Rocklin 
charging free energy correction terms under PME electrostatic calculations 

# Folders

sodium_ion : input files for running a simulation on a sodium ion in a water box (25 A edge). 
             The scripts provided allow the computation of discharging and vanishing free
             energies on a Ubuntu 14.04 workstation, CUDA 7.5 and OpenMM 7.0             


hostguest : input files to run a host-guest simulation in OpenMM. The input files are for the 
	    SAMPL4 OA-O1 system. These scripts have been tested on our local cluster, using 
            Sire 2017.3.0, OpenMM 7.0.1 and CUDA 7.5
