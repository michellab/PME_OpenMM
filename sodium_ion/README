# Hydration free energy of a sodium ion 

These scripts allow to run alchemical free energy calculations for a sodium ion in a water (TIP3P) box.
The scripts have been tested on a Ubuntu 14.04 workstation, with CUDA 7.5 and OpenMM 7.0. 
With the current input files you can run a simulation on a box of 25 A edge and 10 A cutoff.

# Folders

scripts : here you can find the script to run the simulations and compute Rocklin corrections. 
       
	  discharging.py -->  run a discharging free energy calculation 
          vanishing.py   -->  run a vanishing free energy calculation 
          corrections.py -->  run Rocklin correction scheme 

In each script you can find details about how they work. 

# Examples

To run a simulation you can proceed in this way:

```
mkdir run001
cd run001
mkdir input
mkdir output 
cp ../inputfiles/*  input/.
cd output
cp ../../scripts/discharging.py  . 

python discharging.py  
```

This will run 10 equidistand lambda windows calculations, 2 ns long, with SHAKE constraints
on water molecules, 10 A cutoff and PME electrostatics.

Once the simulation has run,  the discharging free energy change will be estimated with MBAR and 
the results will be save in a file ```freenrg-MBAR.dat```.

To run the Rocklin corrections: 

```
cd lambda-0.00

cp ../../input/* . 
cp SYSTEM.top  SYSTEM.prmtop

cp ../../../scripts/corrections.py . 

python corrections.py trajectory.dcd  SYSTEM.prmtop 

```

This script will compute average discharging free energy correction terms every 100 frames of the trajectory.
The script invokes APBS for the integral calculations. The APBS version used was 1.4.1
